## concept
[Whale fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_fall) is an important and special system in the deep sea.</br>
It represent a lot of things, like the death and life, the rebirth, the relationship of different creatures, the energy transformation in a dynamic system,  how the time pass(the whale fall will last for about a hundred year generally).</br>
The recent version would more focus on how people interact with the “creature”, let them feel and touch the installation, to understand how this system operate.</br>
Audience firstly input a shape they created, put it into a cylinder, then insert it into the installation.</br>
The shape they make would output the image on the screen/or **other form to output**.</br>
The other interactive way is by using the gesture detection to control the “creature” , like making a fist to control the “shell”, or swing hands to swimming the fishes.</br>
For building a atmosphere of the deep sea, the Buzzer will output some echo sounds, base on the water level(you need to put the clay into the water). This represent that actually we can’t see anything in the deep sea as there is no light penetrate in it. But we still can hear sound(of course we can see the image in the installation, but in reality no.), the higher of the water level, means more “creatures”(clay) in the sea, so that the more sound will be output.</br>

### Thinking
1. As for the output , except the screen are there some other way to built the scenes. Like using the pipe to wave a whale and other creature? But if using the pipe, so how can the clay also join into the same scenes.
2. What if remove all the concretization stuff, just remain the electric components to build a cyberpunk scenes? Like a metal whale? As actually the whale fall is a kind of energy transformation, this also happened in electric system, or the robot world.
3. Another way to interact is building the fake fishes, embodied different sensor, let the fake fishes interact with the dead whale. Like building a real “electric” bio system.
