## CONDUCTIVE CLAY

This was my most favorite part lol.

i followed the guide here:

[How To Make Squishy Circuits | Makerspace Projects](https://www.makerspaces.com/squishy-circuits/)

And here is the process i made.

And i succeed. But one things i found very interesting was, the brightness of the LED seems not as normal. Which mean the clay have a certain resistor value and that seems to be relevant to how much oil and lemon juice i put in it, or maybe relevant to how big the clay it self. Any way this mean i found a new thing as an new input.

## Buzzer

Buzzer is a quite simple stuff but by coding inside you will gain many stunning and fancy effect.

I just used the most simple coding here because i want to represent the wired sound from the deep sea, which make people fell horrible like there is a monster inside. The deep sea is mystery isn't it?

      tone(speakerPin,800-noise-val/2,1000);
      delay(1000);
      tone(speakerPin, 800-noise-val/3,1000);

The noise and the val are from the LED status and the value of the CLAY, and two sound play alternately to build a bizarre sound.

Here is the final effect:

## NEXT STEP

The next step is to build the case and make some decorate in side the case.
